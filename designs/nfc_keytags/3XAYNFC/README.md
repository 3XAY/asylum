This is my submission for the NFC Asylum YSWS by Hack Club.
It is made in Blender and took way too long (my logo is a pain to model).
The cavity starts at 0.8mm and ends at 1.2mm.
Everything below 2.0mm is black, and the rest is white.

Ignore the weird artifacting, I just couldn't get it to go away. And DO NOT fix the stl when you import it into a slicer to print, it WILL remove the cavity.
